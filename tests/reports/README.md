# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains automated test execution and coverage reports generated by GitHub Actions.

## ðŸ“Š Report Types

### Test Execution Reports
- `test-results.txt` - Complete test execution output
- `test-summary.md` - Formatted test execution summary with metadata

### Coverage Reports
- `coverage-summary.txt` - Text summary of code coverage
- `coverage-detailed.txt` - Detailed coverage report with missing lines
- `coverage.xml` - XML format coverage report (for CI/CD integration)
- `coverage.json` - JSON format coverage report (for programmatic access)
- `coverage-html/` - HTML coverage report directory (interactive)

## ðŸ”„ Generation

Reports are automatically generated by the `test-coverage.yml` GitHub Actions workflow:

### Automatic Triggers
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull request closure (merge)
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Report Contents
Each report includes:
- Test execution results and statistics
- Code coverage analysis
- Branch/commit metadata
- Execution timestamp
- Python version information

## ðŸ“ˆ Coverage Configuration

Coverage reporting is configured via `.coveragerc` in the project root:
- Source code analysis: `c_to_plantuml/` directory
- Excludes test files, virtual environments, and cache directories
- Generates HTML, XML, and JSON formats
- Shows missing line numbers for uncovered code

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

### View Latest Reports
- **HTML Coverage**: Open `coverage-html/index.html` in a browser
- **Text Summary**: View `coverage-summary.txt` for quick overview
- **Detailed Analysis**: Check `coverage-detailed.txt` for line-by-line coverage

### CI/CD Integration
- XML reports are compatible with most CI/CD platforms
- JSON reports can be processed programmatically
- Reports are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts

## ðŸ“‹ Maintenance

- Reports are updated automatically on main branch changes
- Old artifacts are retained for 30 days
- Reports are committed to the repository for historical tracking
