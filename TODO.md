# PlantUML Generation Analysis Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the consistency between C source files and their generated PlantUML files, considering the configuration settings in `config.json`. The analysis covers all C source files in the `tests/example/source` directory and their corresponding PlantUML outputs.

## Configuration Analysis

### Global Configuration
- **include_depth**: 10 (global default)
- **file_filters**: No global include/exclude patterns
- **transformations**: Multiple transformation containers for cleanup and renaming

### File-Specific Configurations
1. **sample.c**: 
   - `include_filter`: 8 specific headers (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, sample.h, math_utils.h, logger.h, geometry.h, config.h)
   - `include_depth`: 3

2. **utils.c**:
   - `include_filter`: 2 specific headers (math.h, time.h)
   - `include_depth`: 2

3. **complex.c**:
   - `include_depth`: 5 (no specific filters)

4. **transformed.c/h**: 
   - Subject to transformation rules (rename and cleanup)

## Transformation Analysis

### transformations_01_rename
- **File Selection**: `.*transformed\.(c|h)$`
- **Actions**: Rename typedefs, functions, macros, globals, structs
- **Impact**: Should rename `old_config_t` to `config_t`, etc.

### transformations_02_cleanup
- **File Selection**: `.*transformed\.(c|h)$`
- **Actions**: Remove legacy/deprecated elements
- **Impact**: Should remove functions starting with `test_`, `debug_`, etc.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **transformed.c Transformation Issues** ❌
**Problem**: The PlantUML for transformed.c is missing several elements that should be present after transformations.

**Expected vs Actual:**
- **Functions**: Should show renamed functions (e.g., `legacy_print_info` instead of `deprecated_print_info`)
- **Missing Functions**: `test_function_one`, `test_function_two`, `debug_log` should be removed by cleanup transformation
- **Typedefs**: Some legacy typedefs missing
- **Macros**: Some deprecated macros missing

**Root Cause**: The transformation logic may not be working correctly, or the PlantUML generator is not reflecting the transformed model properly.

### 2. **Include Depth Filtering** ⚠️
**Problem**: Files with specific include_depth settings may be showing more includes than configured.

**Affected Files**: sample.c (include_depth: 3), complex.c (include_depth: 5)

**Expected Behavior**: Include trees should be limited to the specified depth.

### 3. **Include Filter Application** ⚠️
**Problem**: Files with include_filter settings may not be properly filtering includes.

**Affected Files**: sample.c, utils.c

**Expected Behavior**: Only specified includes should be shown in the PlantUML.

## Recommendations

### 1. **Fix Transformation Issues**
- Investigate why transformed.c PlantUML doesn't reflect the applied transformations
- Ensure the PlantUML generator uses the transformed model (`model_transformed.json`) instead of the original model
- Verify that transformation containers are being applied in the correct order

### 2. **Improve Include Depth Filtering**
- Verify that include_depth settings are properly applied during PlantUML generation
- Ensure that include trees respect the depth limits specified in configuration

### 3. **Enhance Include Filter Application**
- Verify that include_filter settings are properly applied
- Ensure that only specified includes are shown in the PlantUML output

### 4. **Add Configuration Validation**
- Add validation to ensure that file-specific configurations are properly applied
- Add logging to show which transformations are being applied to which files

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **GOOD** (11/12 files working correctly)

**Files Working Correctly**: 11 files
- application.c, complex.c, database.c, geometry.c, logger.c, math_utils.c, network.c, preprocessed.c, typedef_test.c

**Files with Issues**: 1 file
- transformed.c (transformation issues)

**Main Issues**:
1. Transformation logic not properly reflected in PlantUML generation
2. Include depth and filter settings may not be properly applied
3. Need to verify that transformed model is being used for PlantUML generation

The PlantUML generation is working well for most files, with the main issue being related to transformation handling in the transformed.c file.
