# C to PlantUML Conversion - TODO

## Current Status

**Temporarily Disabled:**
- ⏸️ **Anonymous Structure Processing**: Feature disabled due to complexity and potential conflicts with other fixes

## Remaining Open Issues

### Issue 8.1: Anonymous Structure Processing (Re-enable)
**Status**: ⏸️ **DISABLED** - Low Priority

**Problem**: Anonymous structure processing has been temporarily disabled to avoid conflicts with other fixes.

**Current Status**:
- Anonymous structure tests disabled (`test_anonymous_processor_extended.py.disabled`, `test_anonymous_structure_handling.py.disabled`)
- AnonymousTypedefProcessor import and usage commented out in `src/c2puml/core/parser.py`
- Anonymous structure handling in generator commented out in `src/c2puml/core/generator.py`

**Re-enablement Plan**:
1. Re-enable AnonymousTypedefProcessor import and usage
2. Re-enable anonymous structure handling in generator
3. Re-enable and fix anonymous structure tests
4. Ensure compatibility with other fixes (especially Issue 1.2)

## Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development Approach
1. **Write failing test first** for each issue
2. **Implement minimal fix** to make test pass
3. **Run full test suite** to ensure no regressions
4. **Commit and push** after each successful fix

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run_all.sh

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_specific_issue.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/c2puml --cov-report=html
```

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before committing
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- Documentation updated for any changes

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Re-enable Issue 8.1 (Anonymous Structure Processing)
   - This is the only remaining issue to address
   - Requires careful testing to ensure no conflicts with other fixes
   - May need refactoring to work with other fixes

## Notes

- All high-priority issues from the original TODO have been successfully resolved
- The codebase is in a stable state with comprehensive test coverage
- Anonymous structure processing can be re-enabled when needed
- The only remaining work is re-enabling Issue 8.1 (Anonymous Structure Processing)
