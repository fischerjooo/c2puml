# Testing & Workflow

## Test Structure  
- `tests/unit/`: Individual components
- `tests/feature/`: Complete workflows  
- `tests/integration/`: End-to-end scenarios
- Target 90%+ coverage with pytest

## Development Workflow
```bash
# Debug & development
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Integration testing  
./scripts/run_example.sh

# Full regression testing
./scripts/run_all.sh

# Generate PNG images (optional)
./scripts/picgen.sh
```

## TDD Process
1. Write failing test that reproduces issue/requirement
2. Implement minimum code to make test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
