# Testing

## Test Framework and Structure
- Use `pytest` for all unit and integration tests.
- Name all test files with the prefix `test_`, and place them in the `tests/` directory.

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Every new function must be accompanied by tests that cover normal, edge, and failure cases.
- Target 90%+ test coverage, tracked by `coverage.py`.
- Avoid testing internal implementation details; test behaviors instead.
