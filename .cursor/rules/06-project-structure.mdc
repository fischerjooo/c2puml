# Project Structure

## Organization Principles
- Keep logic and I/O separate. Pure logic in `src/`, entry points in `main.py` or CLI.
- Avoid deeply nested directories. Prefer flat and clear structure.
- Use `__init__.py` to define module boundaries when needed.
- Group related files together (e.g. models, services, tests).
