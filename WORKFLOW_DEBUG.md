# GitHub Actions Workflow Debug Guide

## Issue: test-coverage.yml not uploading modified files

### Problem Analysis

The `test-coverage.yml` GitHub Actions workflow was not properly uploading modified files due to several issues:

1. **Conditional Logic Problems**: The workflow only committed and pushed files under very specific conditions that weren't being met reliably.

2. **Missing Manual Trigger Support**: The workflow had `workflow_dispatch` trigger but didn't handle manual triggers in the commit logic.

3. **Permission Issues**: The workflow might not have had the right permissions to push to the main branch when triggered from a PR context.

4. **Token Issues**: Using `github.token` which has limited permissions in PR contexts.

### Root Causes

1. **Complex Conditional Logic**: The original condition was:
   ```yaml
   if: (github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main') || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main')
   ```

2. **PR Context Issues**: When a PR is merged, the workflow runs in the PR context, but the `github.event.pull_request.merged` property might not be reliable.

3. **Branch Switching**: The workflow didn't properly handle switching to the main branch when running from a PR context.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Debugging
- Added a debug step that logs all workflow context variables
- Added debug information to the workflow summary
- Created a local debug script (`test_workflow_debug.sh`) to test logic locally

#### 2. Improved Conditional Logic
- Replaced complex YAML conditions with bash script logic
- Added support for manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Better handling of different event types
- More explicit logging of decision points

#### 3. Better Branch Handling
- Added explicit branch switching logic
- Ensures we're on the main branch before committing
- Uses `git fetch` and `git checkout` to switch branches safely

#### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added more detailed logging
- Better error messages
- Graceful handling of edge cases

### Key Changes

#### Before:
```yaml
- name: üöÄ Commit and push coverage reports
  if: (github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main') || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main')
```

#### After:
```yaml
- name: üöÄ Commit and push coverage reports
  if: always()
  run: |
    # Determine if we should commit and push
    SHOULD_COMMIT=false
    
    if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "workflow_dispatch" ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ Manual trigger detected - will commit and push"
      SHOULD_COMMIT=true
      TARGET_BRANCH="main"
    elif [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "push" ] && [ "${{ github.ref }}" = "refs/heads/main" ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ Direct push to main detected - will commit and push"
      SHOULD_COMMIT=true
      TARGET_BRANCH="main"
    elif [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
      if [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.merged }}" = "true" ] && [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}" = "main" ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Merged PR to main detected - will commit and push"
        SHOULD_COMMIT=true
        TARGET_BRANCH="main"
      else
        echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è PR not merged or not to main - skipping commit and push"
      fi
    fi
```

### Testing

#### Local Testing
Run the debug script to test the logic locally:
```bash
./test_workflow_debug.sh
```

#### Manual Workflow Trigger
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Test Suite with Coverage Reports
3. Click "Run workflow" to trigger manually
4. Check the logs for debug information

### Expected Behavior

The workflow should now:

1. **Always run the tests and generate reports** regardless of trigger type
2. **Commit and push files when**:
   - Manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`)
   - Direct push to main branch
   - Merged PR to main branch
3. **Skip commit and push when**:
   - PR is not merged
   - PR is not targeting main branch
   - Other event types
4. **Provide detailed logging** about why decisions were made

### Troubleshooting

If the workflow still doesn't upload files:

1. **Check the debug output** in the workflow logs
2. **Verify the trigger conditions** are being met
3. **Check repository permissions** for the GitHub Actions bot
4. **Verify the PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN** secret is configured (optional but recommended)
5. **Run the local debug script** to test logic

### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` - Main workflow file
- `test_workflow_debug.sh` - Local debug script
- `WORKFLOW_DEBUG.md` - This documentation

### Next Steps

1. Test the workflow with a manual trigger
2. Monitor the next PR merge to ensure it works
3. Check the debug output to verify the logic is working correctly
4. Consider adding a Personal Access Token secret for more reliable authentication
