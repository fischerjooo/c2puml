# GitHub Actions Workflow Debug Guide

## Issue: test-coverage.yml not uploading modified files

### Problem Analysis

The `test-coverage.yml` GitHub Actions workflow was not properly uploading modified files due to several issues:

1. **Conditional Logic Problems**: The workflow only committed and pushed files under very specific conditions that weren't being met reliably.

2. **Missing Manual Trigger Support**: The workflow had `workflow_dispatch` trigger but didn't handle manual triggers in the commit logic.

3. **Permission Issues**: The workflow might not have had the right permissions to push to the main branch when triggered from a PR context.

4. **Token Issues**: Using `github.token` which has limited permissions in PR contexts.

5. **Branch Switching Issues**: The workflow tried to switch branches with uncommitted changes, causing "local changes would be overwritten" errors.

6. **Non-Fast-Forward Push Errors**: The workflow failed to push to main when the main branch had been updated since the workflow started.

### Root Causes

1. **Complex Conditional Logic**: The original condition was:
   ```yaml
   if: (github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main') || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main')
   ```

2. **PR Context Issues**: When a PR is merged, the workflow runs in the PR context, but the `github.event.pull_request.merged` property might not be reliable.

3. **Branch Switching Problems**: The workflow tried to switch to main branch before committing changes, which failed when there were uncommitted files.

4. **Push Conflicts**: When pushing from a feature branch to main, the main branch might have been updated, causing non-fast-forward errors.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Debugging
- Added a debug step that logs all workflow context variables
- Added debug information to the workflow summary
- Created a local debug script (`test_workflow_debug.sh`) to test logic locally

#### 2. Improved Conditional Logic
- Replaced complex YAML conditions with bash script logic
- Added support for manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Better handling of different event types
- More explicit logging of decision points

#### 3. Simplified Branch Handling
- **Fixed**: Commit changes first, then push to target branch
- **Removed**: Complex branch switching logic that caused conflicts
- **Added**: Smart push strategy that works from any branch context
- Uses `git push origin HEAD:main` when pushing to main from a different branch

#### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added more detailed logging
- Better error messages
- Graceful handling of edge cases

#### 5. Non-Fast-Forward Push Handling
- **Added**: Fetch latest main branch before pushing
- **Added**: Fallback to create coverage branch if push fails
- **Added**: Timestamped branch names for coverage reports
- **Added**: Clear messaging about alternative approaches

### Key Changes

#### Before (Problematic):
```yaml
- name: üöÄ Commit and push coverage reports
  if: (github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main') || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.merged == true && github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main')
  run: |
    # Switch to main branch first (CAUSED ERROR)
    git checkout main
    # Add and commit files
    git add tests/reports/
    git commit -m "Update coverage"
    git push origin main
```

#### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- name: üöÄ Commit and push coverage reports
  if: always()
  run: |
    # Determine if we should commit and push
    SHOULD_COMMIT=false
    
    if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "workflow_dispatch" ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ Manual trigger detected - will commit and push"
      SHOULD_COMMIT=true
      TARGET_BRANCH="main"
    elif [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "push" ] && [ "${{ github.ref }}" = "refs/heads/main" ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ Direct push to main detected - will commit and push"
      SHOULD_COMMIT=true
      TARGET_BRANCH="main"
    elif [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
      if [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.merged }}" = "true" ] && [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}" = "main" ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Merged PR to main detected - will commit and push"
        SHOULD_COMMIT=true
        TARGET_BRANCH="main"
      else
        echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è PR not merged or not to main - skipping commit and push"
      fi
    fi
    
    if [ "$SHOULD_COMMIT" = "true" ]; then
      # Add and commit files first
      git add tests/reports/
      git commit -F /tmp/commit_msg
      
      # Push to target branch using smart strategy
      if [ "${{ github.ref }}" != "refs/heads/$TARGET_BRANCH" ]; then
        # Fetch latest main branch
        git fetch origin "$TARGET_BRANCH:$TARGET_BRANCH"
        
        # Try to push to main branch
        if git push origin "HEAD:$TARGET_BRANCH"; then
          echo "‚úÖ Successfully pushed to $TARGET_BRANCH"
        else
          # Create coverage branch as fallback
          COVERAGE_BRANCH="coverage-reports-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
          git push origin "HEAD:$COVERAGE_BRANCH"
        fi
      else
        git push origin "${{ github.ref }}"
      fi
    fi
```

### Testing

#### Local Testing
Run the debug script to test the logic locally:
```bash
./test_workflow_debug.sh
```

#### Manual Workflow Trigger
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Test Suite with Coverage Reports
3. Click "Run workflow" to trigger manually
4. Check the logs for debug information

### Expected Behavior

The workflow should now:

1. **Always run the tests and generate reports** regardless of trigger type
2. **Commit and push files when**:
   - Manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`)
   - Direct push to main branch
   - Merged PR to main branch
3. **Skip commit and push when**:
   - PR is not merged
   - PR is not targeting main branch
   - Other event types
4. **Provide detailed logging** about why decisions were made
5. **Handle branch contexts properly** without switching branches with uncommitted changes
6. **Handle push conflicts gracefully** by creating coverage branches when needed

### Troubleshooting

If the workflow still doesn't upload files:

1. **Check the debug output** in the workflow logs
2. **Verify the trigger conditions** are being met
3. **Check repository permissions** for the GitHub Actions bot
4. **Verify the PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN** secret is configured (optional but recommended)
5. **Run the local debug script** to test logic
6. **Check for branch switching errors** - should no longer occur
7. **Check for push conflicts** - workflow will create coverage branches as fallback

### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` - Main workflow file (fixed branch switching and push conflicts)
- `test_workflow_debug.sh` - Local debug script (updated with push strategy)
- `WORKFLOW_DEBUG.md` - This documentation (updated with fix details)

### Next Steps

1. Test the workflow with a manual trigger
2. Monitor the next PR merge to ensure it works
3. Check the debug output to verify the logic is working correctly
4. Consider adding a Personal Access Token secret for more reliable authentication

### Recent Fixes (Latest Updates)

#### Fix 1: Branch Switching Error
**Issue**: Workflow failed with "Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout"

**Root Cause**: The workflow was trying to switch to the main branch before committing the generated coverage reports, causing a conflict.

**Solution**: 
1. Commit the generated files first
2. Use smart push strategy: `git push origin HEAD:main` when pushing to main from a different branch
3. Removed complex branch switching logic that caused conflicts

#### Fix 2: Non-Fast-Forward Push Error
**Issue**: Workflow failed with "Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote counterpart"

**Root Cause**: The main branch was updated since the workflow started, causing a non-fast-forward error when trying to push.

**Solution**:
1. Fetch the latest main branch before pushing
2. Try to push to main branch first
3. If that fails, create a timestamped coverage branch as fallback
4. Provide clear messaging about the alternative approach

**Result**: The workflow now handles push conflicts gracefully and ensures coverage reports are always saved.
